compute_likely_paths: processes pathline file to come up with a "representative" particle path for each water source; this was used to pass coordinates to DJ for cross-sections (Figure 12)

create_hydrograph_key: generic LA model script for putting together a legend that describes the layers corresponding to the "official" report colors

map_figure1.py: attempt at making a basemap using Python; not the neatest but it has some good stuff (Figure 1)

particle_combined.py: makes two-part figure with map of particle cells on left and particle configuration on right (Figure 5)

particle_configuration.py: makes right part of Figure 5 (not currently used in article)

particle_map.py: makes left part of Figure 5 (not currently used in article)

plot_budget_and_percent_diff.py: compares LACPGM-MF6 and LACPGM-USG model budgets; taken from another directory so paths may need to be modified (Figure 3)

plot_ghb_layer_thickness.py: makes figure of layer thicknesses at the Whittier  Narrows GHB (in presentation, slide 5, not in article)

plot_pumping_recharge.py: analyzes pumping and recharge and then plots the most "representative" years selected (Figure 4)

plot_spreading.py: makes bar chart of annual spreading grounds water (Figure 2)

write_coords.py: makes a list of UTM coordinates from the shapefile corresponding to cross-section A-A' in LA model report (auxiliary script)
